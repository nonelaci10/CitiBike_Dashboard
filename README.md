# CitiBike_Dashboard

Present here is my approach with database collected and analyzed on CitiBike system data (site: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). 
My main focus was narrowed down from May 2019 to the most recent data (of May 2020). The bike sharing company of CitiBike first launched in 2013 and over the years have continued growing in popularity in the New York metro area.
I narrowed down my data due to the load amount of data files, I wanted to focus on the period before COVID-19 and currently now (since we fear of a second waves of it).
Now that a lot of states in the US is reopening slowly in phases, there is a growing increase of outdoor activities (despites still trying to follow social-distancing).
I wanted to present the popularity of outdoor bike riding, which peaked in the summer of 2019 and seeing if the popularity will grow again this summer of 2020. With the previous restrictions of social distancing and being placed under "stay at home" orders from states.
Tons of individuals were placed at home (and possibility developed cabin-fever) and had their outdoor acitivities limited. Possibility hoping this bike sharing analysis approach could provide an additional view on how fast or the flow of our economy will fall back into place as before.
If not, prediciting if we can see a change, whether positive or not, we have a solution to improve for the better.
